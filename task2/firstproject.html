            <h2>Random Password Generator Project</h2><br>
             <h3>Overview</h3>
              Developing a basic web application, such as a random password generator, serves as an introductory project for grasping the concepts of URL paths within the context of Django and Python full-stack development.
    
              <h3>Explanation:</h3>

              <ul>
                  <li>"Random password generator": This refers to a tool that generates random passwords based on specified criteria, such as length or character types.</li>
                  <br><li>"Basic web application": The project involves building a simple web-based tool for generating random passwords.</li>
                  <br><li>"URL paths": URL paths are specific routes within a web application that dictate how different pages or functionalities are accessed. In Django, URL paths are defined in the project's URLs configuration 
                    to determine how the application responds to different URLs.</li>
             </ul>
